            Players take the role of a character who takes over his or her deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. 
            The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores, selling produce, 
            and socializing with the townspeople, including marriage and having children. It also allows up to three other players to play together online.

            approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. 
            Stardew Valley was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 10 million copies by 2020.

                    Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by the 

                    <!-- Linked Harvest Moon's wikipedia-->
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)" target="_blank"><i>Harvest Moon</i></a> 

                    video game series. At the start of the game, players create their character, 
                    who becomes the recipient of a plot of land and a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town. Players may select from several 
                    different farm map types, each having benefits and drawbacks. The farm plot is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and players must work 
                    to clear them in order to restart the farm, tending to crops and livestock so as to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Players may also interact with non-player characters (NPC) that inhabit the town, including engaging in relationships with them; this can culminate in marriage, 
                    which results in the NPC helping the player's character to tend the farm. Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, and crafting, and also explore 
                    procedurally-generated caves with materials and ores to mine or creatures to combat. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work 
                    at completing specific collections of materials (called "bundles") to restore the town's Community Center. 
                    Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, 
                    such as a desert.[3] All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health and exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. 
                    The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having four 28-day months that represent each season, and this determines which crops can be grown and which 
                    activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a greenhouse which is able to grow any crop regardless of the season.

                    <i>Stardew Valley</i> was created by American indie game designer Eric Barone, under the alias of

                    In 2011, Barone had graduated from the

                    with a computer science degree, but had not been able to get a job in the industry, 
                    instead working as an usher at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. Looking to improve his computer skills for better job prospects, he came to the 
                    idea of crafting a game which would also pull in his artistic side. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, Barone incorporated many elements of the region into 
                    the gameplay and art.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Stardew Valley</i> originally began as a modern fan-made alternative to the 
                    
                    <!-- Linked Harvest Moon's wikipedia -->
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)" target="_blank"><i>Harvest Moon</i></a> series, 
                    
                    as he felt "the series had gotten progressively worse after 
                    
                    <!-- Linked Harvest Moon: Back to Nature's wikipedia -->
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Back_to_Nature" target="_blank"><i>Harvest Moon: Back to Nature</i></a>". 
                    
                    Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, Barone began to create 
                    a game similar to the series, stating that his intent was "to address the problems I had with Harvest Moon" and that "no title in the series ever 
                    brought it all together in a perfect way". Barone was also inspired by other games, including

                <p>
                    Initially, Barone considered releasing the title on Xbox Live Indie Games due to the ease of publishing on that platform, 
                    but found early on that his scope for the game became much larger than originally anticipated. Barone publicly announced the game in September 2012, 
                    using Steam's Greenlight system to gauge interest on the game. After the title was shown a great deal of support from the community, Barone began 
                    working on the title in full, engaging with

                    communities to discuss his progress and gain feedback on proposed additions. 
                    Shortly after the Greenlight period in 2013, he was approached by Finn Brice, director of 
                    
                    <!-- Linked Chucklefish's website -->
                    <a href="https://chucklefish.org/" target="_blank">Chucklefish</a>, who offered to help publish the game on release. 
                    
                    Chucklefish took over many of the non-development activities for Barone, such as site hosting and setting up his development wiki. 
                    Barone decided not to use Steam's early access feature for development, as he felt that it was not well suited to <i>Stardew Valley</i>. 
                    Barone spent four years working on the project, redoing it multiple times, and was the sole developer on the game, frequently spending 
                    10 hours or more a day working on it. He programmed it in C# using the Microsoft XNA framework, while also creating all of the game's pixel art and composing 
                    all of the music.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Barone aimed to give players the feeling of immersion in a small farming community, stating that he wanted <i>Stardew Valley</i> to be a fun game, 
                    while also wanting it "to have real-world messages". In contrast to earlier 
                    
                    <!-- Linked Harvest Moon's wikipedia -->
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)" target="_blank"><i>Harvest Moon</i></a> 
                    
                    games, which could end after two years of in-game time has passed, 
                    Barone kept <i>Stardew Valley</i> open-ended so that players would not feel rushed to try to complete everything possible. During development, Barone recognized that 
                    some players would attempt to figure out mechanically how to maximize their farm's yield and profit through spreadsheets and other tools, but hoped that most players 
                    would take the time to learn these on their own. To that end, he designed the cooking aspect of the game purposely not to be profitable, but instead to pay back in 
                    bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills. Barone also opted not to include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging 
                    players to name and tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game. The animals cannot die but, if not tended to, stop 
                    producing products.
                </p>

                <h4>Release</h4>

                <p>
                    In April 2015, Barone announced he intended to release the game only once he felt it was feature complete, refusing to put the game onto the Early Access program, 
                    or accept any pre-sale payments. The game was released for 
                    
                    <!-- Linked Steam page -->
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows</a> 
                    
                    on February 26, 2016. Following its release, Barone continued to work on the game, 
                    taking feedback from the community and patching bugs, and stated plans to add in additional features at a later date. Barone anticipated adding in more end-game content, 
                    as well as ports for other platforms. Barone had stated that he initially planned a four-player cooperative mode to be released in the game at launch. 
                    In this mode, Barone planned that all players would share a common farm, enabling players to all do different tasks related to it, such as one player mining while others 
                    tend to different parts of the farm. The multiplayer feature supports both local area network and remote online connectivity. Barone had planned for public beta 
                    testing of the multiplayer feature in late 2017 for the Windows version, but was still working to improve the network code by early 2018. The multiplayer beta 
                    for Windows was released in April 2018, with it officially launching for all PC platforms on August 1, 2018. In December 2018, the multiplayer update 
                    was released for the

                    In 2018, Barone stated his desire to assemble a team of developers to help continue further development of the game. By 2019, all versions of the game, 
                    except on mobile, were self-published by Barone. <i>Stardew Valley</i> has also seen an active modding community, with players adding various new and altered features to 
                    the game.
