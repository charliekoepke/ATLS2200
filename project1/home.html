    The HTML Choose-Your-Own-Adventure story:

    The person will choose some choices, and determine which random (cursed) 
    item they are (based on actual items I have found on the ground, or in other weird places)

    Should be similar to the personality quiz in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series

    The items include:
    A condom on the sidewalk
    A tampon (unused but open?)
    A shopping cart in a study room
    "They don't think it be like it is, but it do"
    Bald pencil man
    El pollo
    Mannequin legs
    Bart Simson statue
