                is active on Twitter, and posts their music to YouTube, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp. In Love With a Ghost goes by they/them pronouns, and even has a song
                describing how they feel neither like a boy or a girl, titled 'am i a boy? am i a girl? do i really care? i'm hungry anyway'. They have collaborated with fellow
