            Hi, my name is Charlie Koepke. I'm a second-year CTD major with a CS minor. I have a passion for music and arts. I play four instruments (violin, piano, ukulele, and guitar).
            In my freetime, I like to play my guitar and relax with my dog. I like to type as well, and I'm a mechanical keyboard enthusiast.

        <p>Here is a very bad picture of me. And also a picture of my dog</p>
