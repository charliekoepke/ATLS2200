		<p>
			Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is a 2002 American epic space-opera film directed by George Lucas and written by Lucas and Jonathan Hales. 
			It is the second installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the fifth Star Wars film to be produced, and the second film in the "Skywalker saga." 
			It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. 
			Set ten years after the events in The Phantom Menace, the plot sees the galaxy on the brink of civil war, with thousands of planetary systems threatening to secede 
			from the Galactic Republic and join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by the former Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Count Dooku. 
			After Senator Padmé Amidala evades an assassination attempt, Jedi Apprentice Anakin Skywalker becomes her protector and develops a secret relationship with her, 
			while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates the attempt on her life, leading him to uncover a clone army in service of the Republic. 
			Soon, the trio witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy: the Clone Wars.
