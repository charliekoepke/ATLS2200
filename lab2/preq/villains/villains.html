		<!-- Villain 1 short description -->
		<p>
			Jar Jar Binks was a Gungan male military commander and politician who played a key role during the Invasion of Naboo and the Clone 
			Wars that culminated in the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Once an outcast from Gungan society due to his clumsy behavior,
			he regained favor with his people by helping secure an alliance between the Gungan boss Rugor Nass and Queen Padm√© Amidala of Naboo, an alliance vital in 
			ending the Trade Federation's invasion of their shared homeworld. In the years that followed, Binks became a Junior Representative for his people in the Galactic Senate, 
			serving alongside Amidala once she became the planet's senator.

		<!-- Villain 2 short description -->
		<p>
			Maul, once known as Darth Maul, was a Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male who established himself as a crime lord during the reign of the Galactic Empire. 
			Once, however, he was the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, 
			Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return 
			to power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.

		<!-- Villain 3 short description -->
		<p>
			Darth Sidious, born Sheev Palpatine and known simply as the Emperor, was a human male Dark Lord of the Sith who reigned over the galaxy as Galactic 
			Emperor of the First Galactic Empire. Rising to power in the Galactic Senate as the senator of Naboo, the manipulative Sith Lord cultivated two identities, 
			Sidious and Palpatine, using both to further his political career. He masterminded the Clone Wars in order to gain dictatorial powers during the final years of 
			the Galactic Republic. After the fall of the Jedi Order, Sidious established a reign lasting from 19 BBY until his demise in 4 ABY. Death was not the end for Sidious, 
			however, as the dark side of the Force was a pathway to abilities that made his return possible.
