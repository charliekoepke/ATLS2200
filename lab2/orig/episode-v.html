			The Empire Strikes Back, also known as Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back, is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner 
			and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George Lucas. Produced by Lucasfilm, it is the second film in the Star Wars film series 
			(and the fifth chronologically) and the sequel to Star Wars (1977).[a] Set three years after the events of the first film, the plot sees the Galactic Empire hunting the 
			scattered Rebel Alliance throughout the galaxy. While Darth Vader relentlessly pursues Luke Skywalker's friends — Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca—Luke studies the 
			Force under Jedi Master Yoda to prepare himself for his upcoming confrontation with Vader. The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, 
			Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.
