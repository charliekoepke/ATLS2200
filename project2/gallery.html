                    This is the type specimen poster assignment that I did for <a href="https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?P=ATLS%202300" target="_blank">ATLS 2300: Type</a>. 
                    The poster is for the font <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Gothic" target="_blank">"News Gothic"</a>. 
                    I used a newspaper format to illustrate the use of the News Gothic font in print newspaper. 
                    Some other examples of things that use News Gothic font are the band <a href="https://abbasite.com/" target="_blank">ABBA</a>, Lady Gaga, Alfred Hitchcock, and Star Wars
                    to name a few.

                    This is an animation assignment that I did for <a href="https://catalog.colorado.edu/search/?P=ATLS%202100" target="_blank">ATLS 2100: Image</a>. 
                    The assignment was an animated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku" target="_blank">haiku</a>, 
                    which we could generate ourselves or use something else.
                    I realised that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mYBSayCsH0" target="_blank">"I'm a Believer" by: Smash Mouth</a>, which was featured in 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek" target="_blank">Shrek</a>, 
                    had the same rhythm pattern that was needed in a haiku, and decided to animate the haiku with the soundtrack in the back.

                    The assignment was animated story telling. I decided to animate a favourite TikTok of mine from 
                    <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@morepestoplease/video/6925539575825779974?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v3" target="_blank">@morepestoplease</a>. 
                    I used mostly text and pictures to tell the story, and I animated it in such a way to reflect what I felt was the mood and tone of the story.

                    The assignment was to make an HTML narrative story. I based my assignment off of the personality test in the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon" target="_blank">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon</a> series, 
                    a favourite video game series of mine.

                    The assignment was to make a band fan page for a favourite band or artist. I decided to create a page for 
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/lvghstmusic?lang=en" target="_blank">In Love with a Ghost</a>, a French musical artist that I have been listening to for a while.
