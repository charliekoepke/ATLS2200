                            Hi, my name is Charlie Koepke. I'm a current sophomore in the 
                            <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/academics/programs/creative-technology-design" target="_blank">CTD program</a> at CU Boulder, and I am also minoring in 
                            <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/undergraduate-programs/computer-science-minor" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>. I am originally from Maryland 
                            but my family moved to Colorado in 2019. I am a proud adopted Asian (from Korea), and a transgender man.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm very interested in graphic design and UI/UX design as well. I also have a passion for music, which is something I've had since I was young. Over the years, 
                            I have learned how to play the guitar, piano, violin, and ukulele, and I am always open to learning more instruments. I have also had experience in music production. 
                            I took a course in my freshman year of high school, and it is something I enjoy to do as a hobby.
                        </p>
